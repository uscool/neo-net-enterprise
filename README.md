# neo-net-enterprise
Tools focusing on Gen-AI integration for start-ups and entrepreneurs. Produced for the Cyber Cypher Hackathon over a period of 18 hours.

# Explanation

This program is meant to act as a helper to startup founders by helping integrate and use Gen-AI with various other tools to simplify their workflow. There is one integrated file that one is expected to run **'0.py'** wheras all other files are individual files that have a specific task or act as a specific tool.  

# The numbers on the files mean the following: 

1. Finding the right people <LinkedIn profiles that could fit targets returned. Needs further fine tuning, uses Custom Google JSON Search Engine.>
2. Market Insights, growth domains
3. AI generated surveys (potential for Forms integration to save even more time-- token issues prevented integration under time limit)
4. Financials management (budgeting and planning)
5. Evaluating options
6. Finding major investors and analysing specific pitches to them <could have further fine tuning with regards to prompt, works fine for now>
7. Marketing
8. SEO
9. Finding potential clients
10. Competitor research and positioning
11. Navigating legalities in decision making (based on stored legal documents (in this case laws.pdf))
12. Setting up meetings and calendar (Google Calendar)

The 'laws.pdf' file is used to run the legality checks in number 11.
